# The Mind Protocol (MemoryForge)

> **Read `.mind/STATE.md` before doing anything.** It tells you where the project is right now.

This project uses **MemoryForge** for persistent memory across sessions. Memory survives context compactions, session restarts, and multi-agent work.

## How It Works

1. **Session Start:** A hook reads `.mind/` files and injects a briefing into context
2. **During Work:** A lightweight state reminder appears before each prompt
3. **Before Compaction:** A checkpoint is saved, then restored after context compression
4. **Session End:** A hook warns if `.mind/` files haven't been updated

## .mind/ Directory

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `STATE.md` | Current phase, status, active work, blockers, next action |
| `PROGRESS.md` | Task tracking with checkboxes |
| `DECISIONS.md` | Decision log with rationale |
| `SESSION-LOG.md` | Summary of each work session |

## Session Rules

| # | Rule |
|---|------|
| A | **Always read STATE.md FIRST** — before any work, know where we are |
| B | **Check PROGRESS.md for what's next** — don't guess, read the queue |
| C | **Check DECISIONS.md for constraints** — past decisions may affect work |
| D | **Update all .mind/ files at session end** — future sessions depend on this |
| E | **Never assume — always check state** — even if you "remember," verify against .mind/ |
