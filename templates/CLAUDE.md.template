## The Mind Protocol

This project uses **MemoryForge** for persistent memory across Claude Code sessions. Memory survives context compactions, session restarts, and multi-day work.

### How It Works

1. **Session Start:** A hook reads `.mind/` files and injects a "Morning Briefing" into context
2. **During Work:** A lightweight state reminder is injected before each prompt
3. **Before Compaction:** A checkpoint is saved, then re-injected after context compression
4. **Session End:** A hook warns if `.mind/` files haven't been updated

### The Persistent Memory Loop

```
Session starts
    |
    v
SessionStart hook --> Reads .mind/ --> Injects briefing into context
    |
    v
Work happens (context grows)
    |
    v
Context approaching limit
    |
    v
PreCompact hook --> Saves checkpoint to .mind/checkpoints/latest.md
    |
    v
Context compacted (compressed)
    |
    v
SessionStart hook fires AGAIN (source=compact) --> Restores full briefing
    |
    v
Work continues with context restored
```

### .mind/ Directory

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `STATE.md` | Current phase, status, active work, blockers, next action |
| `PROGRESS.md` | Phase-by-phase task tracking with checkboxes |
| `DECISIONS.md` | Decision log with rationale and status |
| `SESSION-LOG.md` | Chronological summary of each work session |
| `checkpoints/` | Pre-compaction snapshots (auto-managed) |

### Session Start Checklist

```
[ ] Read .mind/STATE.md — know where we are
[ ] Read .mind/PROGRESS.md — know what's next
[ ] Read .mind/DECISIONS.md — know what constraints exist
[ ] Pick next task
[ ] Work
[ ] Update .mind/ files before ending
```

### Session End Checklist

Before ending any work session, update:

1. `.mind/STATE.md` — Current phase, status, blockers, next action
2. `.mind/PROGRESS.md` — Check off completed tasks, add new ones
3. `.mind/DECISIONS.md` — Record any decisions made (if applicable)
4. `.mind/SESSION-LOG.md` — Append session summary

### Rules

| # | Rule |
|---|------|
| A | **Always read STATE.md FIRST** — before any work, know where we are |
| B | **Check PROGRESS.md for what's next** — don't guess, read the queue |
| C | **Check DECISIONS.md for constraints** — past decisions may affect work |
| D | **Update all .mind/ files at session end** — future sessions depend on this |
| E | **Never assume — always check state** — even if you "remember," verify against .mind/ |
