# Non-Technical Builder — Round 9 Evaluation
**Version:** 1.8.1 | **Verdict:** Yes

## Scores
| Dim | Name | Score | R8 | Delta | Justification |
|-----|------|------:|---:|------:|---------------|
| D1 | Onboarding Clarity | 9 | 9 | 0 | The README remains excellent. The "What Is This?" section answers the what/why within 10 seconds. "In plain English" paragraph is a standout. Before & After comparison makes the value proposition instantly obvious to someone who has hit the "I don't have context" wall even once. The one-liner tagline — "Claude Code forgets everything when context resets. MemoryForge fixes that." — is perfectly calibrated for a non-developer scanning the page. The only reason this is not a 10: the Quick Start still shows three separate install paths (setup.js, install.sh, install.ps1) before a newcomer has the context to choose. Leading with `node setup.js` alone and burying the CLI-installer variants in "Installation Tiers" would remove that moment of hesitation. |
| D2 | Install Simplicity | 8 | 7 | +1 | The Wave 22 additions directly address my R8 complaints. `setup.js --help` and `--dry-run` are exactly what a cautious non-developer needs. The clone-directory warning catches the single most common mistake ("I cloned the repo and ran the installer from inside it"). The interactive setup.js walks you through directory selection, install-mode choice (Standard / Standard+Team / Minimal), and optional config — all with numbered choices and colored output. That is a genuine one-command experience. Health-check now actually works in installed projects thanks to the P2 fix for missing supporting scripts. Scoring +1 over R8. Remaining gap to a 9: (a) `node setup.js` still requires the user to have already cloned the repo, so there are really two commands (git clone + node setup.js); (b) setup.js does not explain what "MCP memory server" means when printing its progress — a non-tech user sees "Setting up MCP memory server..." and wonders what MCP is. |
| D3 | Concept Accessibility | 8 | 8 | 0 | Jargon has been well-managed since R8 and the status quo is maintained. The README defines "MCP (Model Context Protocol)" on first use. Terms like "hooks," "state files," "compaction," and "briefing" are introduced with plain-English explanations or analogies. The FAQ handles the "why do I need this?" question well. The TROUBLESHOOTING.md is written in symptom-first language ("Symptom: ... Cause: ... Fix: ...") which is exactly the format a non-developer needs. Remaining gap: the config template (`memoryforge.config.json.template`) contains keys like `compressThresholdBytes`, `staleWarningSeconds`, and `briefingMaxProgressLines` with no inline comments (JSON does not support comments, which was a deliberate choice in Wave 19). There is no adjacent README or tooltip explaining what each key does — you have to go back to the main README's configuration table. A separate `CONFIG-REFERENCE.md` or a copy of the table shipped alongside the template would close this gap. |
| D4 | Error Recovery | 8 | 7 | +1 | TROUBLESHOOTING.md now has a dedicated "setup.js fails or shows warnings" section (issue #9 from R8), which was the biggest missing piece. It covers the clone-directory mistake, Node version requirements, and permission errors with copy-paste fix commands. The health-check tool (`node scripts/health-check.js`) produces human-readable output to stderr and structured JSON to stdout — a non-developer can run it and understand "MemoryForge Health Check [OK]" or see actionable warnings. The `--dry-run` flag on both setup.js and the CLI installers lets a cautious user preview before committing. Error messages in setup.js use color-coded symbols (green checkmark, yellow warning, red X) that are visually scannable. Remaining gap: there is no "reset to factory defaults" or "repair" command — if something gets into a bad state, the user has to uninstall and reinstall. Also, the health-check watch mode (--watch) filters out the `--interval` argument from sub-process invocations (line 226 of health-check.js) but the `--interval` value itself is not filtered — this could cause the child process to interpret it as a project directory, though the practical impact is minimal since it would just fail gracefully. |
| D5 | Templates & Examples | 9 | 9 | 0 | This dimension was already near-perfect in R8 and remains so. Four state file templates (.mind/STATE.md, PROGRESS.md, DECISIONS.md, SESSION-LOG.md) are pre-filled with bracket placeholders like `[Phase Name]` that make it obvious what to replace. Three project-type templates (web-app, cli, library) with tailored phase structures. The `templates/mind-example/` directory is the crown jewel — a filled-in mid-project web app at Phase 3 with real-looking completed tasks, pending decisions, blockers, and session history. This completely eliminates the "blank page" problem. The CLAUDE.md.template is concise (33 lines) with a clear rule table. The only miss preventing a 10: the config template ships as bare JSON with no companion explanation file — a non-tech user copying it would not know what `compressThresholdBytes: 12000` means without reading the README table. |
| D6 | Visual Feedback | 10 | 10 | 0 | The dashboard remains best-in-class. `node scripts/dashboard.js .mind/` generates a dark-themed, responsive HTML dashboard that auto-opens in the browser. It has stat cards for progress percentage, sessions logged, decisions recorded, and current phase — all color-coded. Progress bar with percentage. Scrollable cards for each state file with Markdown rendering. The fleet dashboard (`node scripts/fleet-dashboard.js`) gives a multi-project overview. The installer itself has color-coded step-by-step output with [1/7] progress counters. The dashboard.js XSS fix (currentPhase now HTML-escaped) in Wave 22 closes the security gap without any visual regression. Nothing to ask for here. |
| D7 | Confidence | 10 | 10 | 0 | Trust signals are comprehensive. 58 tests across 4 suites. CI matrix: 3 OS x 3 Node versions plus shellcheck linting at error severity. `--dry-run` on all three installers (setup.js, install.sh, install.ps1). Backup before every merge (`settings.json.backup`, `.mcp.json.backup`). Uninstall preserves user data (.mind/ state files) and confirms before removing. Health-check CLI with structured diagnostics. Atomic writes (tmp+rename pattern) in MCP server. Advisory file locking for concurrent access. Symlink rejection on config files. The P2 fix for missing supporting scripts means health-check actually works in installed projects now — previously it was a confidence signal that was broken, which is worse than not having it. No gaps found. |

**Average: 8.86** (R8: 8.57, Delta: +0.29)

## Bugs Found

### P2
(none)

### P3
1. **setup.js `dryInfo` called with wrong arguments** — `setup.js:541`: `dryInfo('config', configPath)` is called but `dryInfo()` only takes a single string message parameter (defined at line 124-127). The second argument `configPath` is silently ignored. In dry-run mode with custom config, the user sees the generic `[dry-run] Would: config` instead of the useful path. The `success()` call on line 542 then fires even in dry-run mode, printing "Saved configuration to .memoryforge.config.json" when nothing was actually saved. This is a logic error: the config-write block (lines 538-545) does not check `DRY_RUN` before calling `success()`.
   - **File:** `D:\MemoryForge\setup.js` lines 538-545
   - **Impact:** Misleading output in dry-run mode — user thinks config was written when it was not.

2. **setup.js --dry-run does not skip version file write** — `setup.js:483`: `fs.writeFileSync(path.join(targetDir, '.memoryforge-version'), VERSION)` executes unconditionally, even when `DRY_RUN` is true. Every other write in the file respects the `DRY_RUN` flag except this one.
   - **File:** `D:\MemoryForge\setup.js` line 483
   - **Impact:** Dry-run is not fully dry — it writes one file. Non-critical but violates the contract of `--dry-run`.

3. **CHANGELOG.md documentation table stale** — `README.md:494`: The documentation table says "Version history (Waves 1-13)" for the CHANGELOG.md entry. The actual CHANGELOG.md documents up through Wave 22 (v1.8.1). This is a cosmetic mismatch that could confuse a user expecting only 13 waves of history.
   - **File:** `D:\MemoryForge\README.md` line 494
   - **Impact:** Minor documentation staleness — no functional impact.

4. **README test count says 58, CHANGELOG says 58, but test breakdown says 23+9+14+12 = 58** — this is actually correct. However, MEMORY.md (project memory) says "50 tests passing" and "58 tests" appears only in the CHANGELOG and README. The project memory file is stale. Not user-facing, but noting for completeness.
   - **File:** Project memory (not user-facing)
   - **Impact:** None for end users.

5. **health-check.js --interval value not filtered from child args** — `health-check.js:226`: The watch-mode filter removes `--watch` and anything starting with `--interval` from the child args, but the bare numeric value following `--interval` (e.g., `60`) is not removed. If the user runs `node health-check.js --watch --interval 60 /my/project`, the child process receives `["/my/project", "60"]` — but since `60` does not start with `--`, it would be treated as the project directory argument on the second run of `args.find(a => !a.startsWith('--'))` at line 27. This means the child process would check directory `60` instead of `/my/project`. Functional impact is low because watch mode is a developer-facing feature, but the argument parsing is incorrect.
   - **File:** `D:\MemoryForge\scripts\health-check.js` lines 226-227
   - **Impact:** Watch mode with custom interval and explicit project directory produces wrong results.

6. **Config template has no companion documentation** — The file `templates/memoryforge.config.json.template` contains 10 keys with numeric values and zero explanation. A non-technical user copying this file to their project has no inline guidance on what the values mean or what ranges are valid. The README has a table, but the template does not reference it. A comment is not possible in JSON, but a sibling `.md` file or a note at the top of the README config section saying "See [Config Reference]" would help.
   - **File:** `D:\MemoryForge\templates\memoryforge.config.json.template`
   - **Impact:** Usability gap — non-tech user must cross-reference README to understand config values.

7. **setup.js Node version check says 18+ but error message on line 133 also says 18+, while README prerequisite says 18+ and TROUBLESHOOTING says 14+** — `docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md:167` says "Check Node.js version (14+ required)" but setup.js checks for 18+ and the README says "Node.js 18+". The troubleshooting guide gives wrong minimum version advice.
   - **File:** `D:\MemoryForge\docs\TROUBLESHOOTING.md` line 167
   - **Impact:** A user on Node 16 would be told by TROUBLESHOOTING that they meet the requirement, but setup.js would reject them.

8. **PowerShell installer missing --help flag** — `README.md:330` documents `--help` for bash but shows `--` (empty) for PowerShell. The install.ps1 script does not implement a `-Help` parameter. This is an asymmetry — a Windows non-tech user who tries `.\install.ps1 -Help` would get no output. The bash installer has `--help` since Wave 22 but the PowerShell equivalent was not implemented.
   - **File:** `D:\MemoryForge\install.ps1` (missing `-Help` switch), `D:\MemoryForge\README.md` line 330
   - **Impact:** Windows users cannot get usage help from the PowerShell installer.

## Verdict Rationale

**Yes — adopt.** MemoryForge v1.8.1 is ready for a non-technical user to install and use with confidence. The Wave 22 fixes land precisely where they needed to: the interactive setup.js is now the clear recommended path, --dry-run and --help give cautious users safe exploration, the clone-directory warning catches the most common mistake, and health-check actually works in installed projects.

The scoring reflects steady incremental improvement: D2 (Install Simplicity) and D4 (Error Recovery) each gained a point from R8 thanks to the setup.js improvements and TROUBLESHOOTING.md additions. D6 (Visual Feedback) and D7 (Confidence) remain at 10 — there is genuinely nothing missing for this persona. The 8 bugs found are all P3 severity, with the most impactful being the dry-run leaks in setup.js (version file write and misleading config success message) and the Node version mismatch in TROUBLESHOOTING.md.

The remaining path to a 9+ average would require: (a) making setup.js fully dry-run safe, (b) adding a config reference document alongside the template, (c) harmonizing the Node version requirement across all docs, and (d) implementing -Help on the PowerShell installer. None of these are blockers for adoption.

For a PM, designer, or founder who uses Claude Code, MemoryForge solves a real problem (context loss) with a one-command install, beautiful visual feedback, and enough safety nets (dry-run, backups, health-check, uninstall) to inspire confidence. The "blank page" problem is solved by excellent templates and a filled-in example. Recommended without reservation.
