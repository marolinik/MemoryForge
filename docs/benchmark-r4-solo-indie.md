# MemoryForge Benchmark Round 4: Solo Indie Developer

PERSONA: Solo Indie Developer (40% of market)
VERDICT: Yes — A genuinely useful, low-friction tool that solves the real pain of context loss without adding dependency hell or config burden.

SCORES:
D1 Time to Value: 8 — Clone, run one bash command, start Claude; you get a briefing on first launch in under 2 minutes, but you still need to manually seed STATE.md with real project info before it delivers actual value.
D2 Install Experience: 9 — Dry-run, smart-merge for brownfield projects, competitor detection, backup creation, clean uninstall preserving user data; this is as thoughtful as install scripts get for a CLI tool.
D3 Daily Workflow: 7 — The session briefing and per-prompt nudge are helpful, but the user-prompt-context hook shells out to Node on every prompt (even with caching, first call is slow), and the stop-checkpoint hook runs git commands on every Claude response which could add latency on large repos.
D4 Context Recovery: 8 — The pre-compact -> compact -> session-start loop is architecturally sound and tested; the checkpoint is written before compaction and re-injected after; post-compaction always uses the full briefing format which is the right call.
D5 Configuration: 9 — Pure JSON config with sensible defaults, every threshold documented, optional override of only what you need, bounds-checked with Math.max() clamping; this is exactly how config should work for a solo dev.
D6 Documentation: 8 — README is clear with Before/After framing, FAQ answers the right questions first, TROUBLESHOOTING covers real issues with verification commands, CHANGELOG is detailed; slight gap is no "How to write a good STATE.md" guide for new users.
D7 Trust: 7 — Zero dependencies, path traversal guards, input size limits, error logging, 50 tests across 4 suites with CI on 3 platforms; the security posture is solid but the reliance on bash+node for hooks means platform edge cases (Windows stat, wc -c whitespace) will always be a minor concern.
AVERAGE: 8.00

STRENGTHS:
- Zero external dependencies is a genuine differentiator; no npm install, no package.json in your project, no supply chain risk. For a solo dev who has been burned by bitrot in node_modules, this is gold.
- The install script is production-grade: dry-run preview, brownfield smart-merge, backup before modification, competitor detection for 6+ systems, clean uninstall that preserves your .mind/ data. This is the kind of installer most open-source tools never bother building.
- The compaction survival loop (pre-compact saves checkpoint, session-start re-injects after compact) is the core value proposition and it is correctly implemented. The `source=compact` path is tested and the full briefing is forced post-compaction regardless of file size. This solves the exact problem it claims to solve.
- Progressive briefing is a smart design: small projects get full context, large projects get a compact nudge with MCP tool pointers. Post-compaction always gets the full briefing. This prevents the tool from eating context in large projects while still providing maximum recovery when it matters most.
- The MCP server is well-engineered: Content-Length framing with proper Buffer handling for multi-byte characters, path traversal guards via safePath(), 50KB input cap, error logging to .mcp-errors.log with rotation, and the hybrid TF-IDF + keyword search is a nice touch for semantic queries.

GAPS:
- No guidance on how to write an effective STATE.md. The template is nearly empty and the example is buried in templates/mind-example/. A solo dev starting fresh will stare at a blank STATE.md and not know what to put there. The tool needs a "Getting Started with your first .mind/" walkthrough.
- The user-prompt-context hook caches output but still shells out to Node for JSON escaping on cache miss. On Windows with Git Bash this adds noticeable latency. The grep+sed extraction is also fragile: it grabs the line directly after the heading, so if STATE.md has a blank line between the heading and content, it returns empty strings.
- No mechanism to force a state save mid-session. The stop-checkpoint hook writes a timestamp and tracks files, but if Claude has been doing significant work and STATE.md is stale, the only signal is a polite reminder after 30 minutes. A solo dev who closes the laptop unexpectedly loses all unsaved context. The session-end auto-summary helps but only captures file names, not what was done.
- Windows experience is second-class. The bash hooks require Git Bash, stat commands use Linux/macOS fallback chains, wc -c needs tr -d whitespace trimming. The PowerShell installer (install.ps1) is mentioned in the README but was not included in the review files, so its parity is unknown.
- The session-start hook runs auto-compression synchronously before producing the briefing. For a project with many sessions, this means the first session start after a long break could be noticeably slow while it compresses SESSION-LOG.md and DECISIONS.md. No progress indicator is shown.

BUGS:
- [P3] user-prompt-context.sh grep fragility: The hook uses `grep -A 1 "^## Current Phase"` to extract state, which grabs exactly one line after the heading. If the STATE.md has a blank line between the heading and the content (valid Markdown), the hook returns an empty string and falls through to "unknown". The example STATE.md in templates/mind-example/ does not have blank lines between headings and content, so it works by convention, but this is not enforced or documented as a requirement. This is a format coupling that will bite users who hand-edit STATE.md with normal Markdown habits.
- [P3] stop-checkpoint.sh stale warning hardcodes "30+ minutes" in the message text regardless of the configured staleWarningSeconds value. If a user sets staleWarningSeconds to 3600 (1 hour), the warning still says "30+ minutes" which is misleading. The threshold check itself respects the config, but the user-facing string does not.
- [P3] session-start.sh config path injection: The hook reads the config threshold using `node -e "...require('fs').readFileSync('$PROJECT_DIR/.memoryforge.config.json'...)"` where `$PROJECT_DIR` is interpolated directly into the Node script string. While `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` is an environment variable set by Claude Code (not user-controlled input), a project path containing single quotes would break the Node script. The MCP server fixed this pattern (Bug #1 in Wave 14) by using process.env, but the session-start hook still uses the old pattern.
- [P3] compress-sessions.js pre-compress backup accumulation: The cleanup function limits .pre-compress backups to 3, but SESSION-LOG.md.pre-compress and DECISIONS.md.pre-compress and PROGRESS.md.pre-compress are all in the same directory. The cleanup counts all .pre-compress files together, meaning with 3 compressible files producing backups simultaneously, you only keep 3 total (not 3 per file). After one compression cycle all 3 are kept; after a second cycle the oldest gets deleted even though it might be a different file's backup. This is minor but could cause confusion if a user wants to recover from a bad compression of a specific file.
