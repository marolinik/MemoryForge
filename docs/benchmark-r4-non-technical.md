# Benchmark Round 4: Non-Technical Builder Persona

PERSONA: Non-Technical Builder (10% of market)
VERDICT: Conditional — The core value proposition is immediately clear and the README is well-written, but the install process, hook internals, and troubleshooting docs all assume command-line fluency that this persona does not have.

SCORES:
D1 README Clarity: 8 — The "What Is This?" section and Before/After comparison explain the problem and solution in plain English within 30 seconds; the "In plain English" paragraph is exactly what this persona needs, though technical terms like "lifecycle hooks," "MCP," and "context compaction" appear before they are defined.
D2 Install Simplicity: 5 — The Quick Start is only 3 steps (clone, run installer, start claude), but it assumes I know what "git clone" does, that I have bash or PowerShell available, and that I can construct a file path argument; there is no "click here to download a zip" option and no GUI installer.
D3 Concept Accessibility: 4 — Terms like "hooks," "MCP (Model Context Protocol)," "TF-IDF," "stdio transport," "Content-Length framing," "brownfield," "path traversal," "smart-merge," "lifecycle events," and "stdin JSON" are used throughout with minimal or no explanation for a non-developer audience; I would have to Google at least 8 terms to follow the README fully.
D4 Error Messages: 5 — The health-check tool outputs structured JSON with severity levels and human-readable summaries, which is good, but the Troubleshooting doc instructs me to run commands like `chmod +x`, `which bash`, `echo '{"source":"startup"}' | bash scripts/hooks/session-start.sh | node -e "..."`, and `cat .claude/settings.json | grep "session-start"` — all of which are unintelligible to someone who Googles "what is bash."
D5 Templates: 7 — Three project-type templates (web-app, CLI, library) plus a filled-in example showing a mid-project state are genuinely helpful and the Markdown format is easy to read and edit; however, the install instructions for templates (`cp -r MemoryForge/templates/mind-web-app/ your-project/.mind/`) assume terminal comfort, and there is no interactive "pick your template" step in the installer.
D6 Visual Tools: 7 — The dashboard generates a polished dark-themed HTML page with progress bars, task counts, session history, and decision logs that opens in a browser automatically; the health check provides clear OK/WARN/ERR status; but both require running `node scripts/dashboard.js .mind/` from a terminal, with no explanation of what "node" is or how to install it if missing.
D7 Confidence: 7 — The installer creates backups before modifying settings, the uninstaller preserves user data (.mind/ state files), dry-run mode lets me preview changes, and there are 50 tests across 4 suites; however, reading the hook scripts reveals raw bash with `set -euo pipefail`, inline Node.js, and piped JSON parsing — if anything goes wrong in that pipeline, I would have zero ability to diagnose it.
AVERAGE: 6.14

STRENGTHS:
- The "What Is This?" and "In Plain English" paragraphs in the README are excellent — they explain the problem (Claude forgets things) and the solution (MemoryForge saves and restores context) without assuming any technical knowledge.
- The Before/After comparison with concrete examples ("Session 1... Session 2...") immediately communicates value in a way a product manager or founder can relate to.
- The .mind/ state files are plain Markdown, which means I can read and edit them in any text editor (VS Code, Notion export, even GitHub web UI) without needing to understand code.
- The filled-in example template (templates/mind-example/) shows exactly what a working .mind/ directory looks like mid-project, with realistic tasks, decisions, and session entries — this removes the "blank page" problem.
- The dashboard HTML output is visually polished, has a progress bar, and auto-opens in the browser — it feels like a real product, not a developer toy.

GAPS:
- No GUI or one-click installer: every installation path requires a terminal command with path arguments. A downloadable installer, a VS Code extension, or even a "drag this folder into your project" approach would dramatically lower the barrier. The PowerShell installer helps for Windows but still requires typing `.\install.ps1 -TargetDir "C:\path\to\your\project"`, which is intimidating for non-technical users.
- Jargon overload without a glossary: the README uses "hooks," "MCP," "TF-IDF," "brownfield," "lifecycle events," "stdin," "stdout," "context compaction," "smart-merge," and "stdio transport" without defining most of them. A non-technical user encounters "8 Hooks, 4 State Files, 6 MCP Tools" as a section header and does not know what a hook is. The term "MCP" is defined once in passing ("Model Context Protocol") but never explained functionally (what does it do for me?).
- The Troubleshooting guide (docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md) is written entirely for developers: every fix involves running bash commands like `chmod +x`, `which bash`, piping JSON through Node.js one-liners, and reading `cat` output piped through `grep`. A non-technical user who encounters "Hooks not firing" cannot follow any of the diagnostic steps. There is no "restart Claude Code and try again" or "delete this folder and re-run the installer" level of guidance.
- Template selection is manual (`cp -r` commands): the installer does not ask "What kind of project are you building?" and offer to set up the right template. This is a missed opportunity for a guided onboarding experience.
- The hook scripts themselves (session-start.sh, user-prompt-context.sh) contain inline Node.js code executed within bash, piped JSON parsing, stat-based file modification time checks, and environment variable expansion — if any of this breaks, the error output will be a bash or Node.js stack trace that is completely opaque to this persona. There is no "something went wrong, here is what to do" user-facing error message from the hooks.

BUGS:
- [P2] The Troubleshooting doc section "Verifying Installation" step 5 instructs users to run a complex piped command (`echo '{"source":"startup"}' | bash scripts/hooks/session-start.sh | node -e "let d='';process.stdin.on('data',c=>d+=c);..."`) that would fail silently or confusingly if Node.js is not installed, if the path is wrong, or if the user is in the wrong directory — and no error guidance is provided for those failure modes.
- [P3] The README says "No databases, no APIs, no npm packages -- just bash scripts and .mind/ files" in the "What Is This?" section, but the hooks actually require Node.js to be installed (they shell out to `node -e` for JSON parsing, TF-IDF indexing, and MCP server operation). This is misleading for a non-technical user who reads "just bash scripts" and does not realize they also need Node.js. The system has zero *npm* dependencies but does require the Node.js runtime itself, which is a meaningful prerequisite that should be stated upfront.
- [P3] The Windows PowerShell installer (install.ps1) does not check whether Node.js is installed before proceeding. If Node.js is missing, the installation will appear to succeed (hooks are copied, settings are written) but hooks will fail silently at runtime because they shell out to `node`. The bash installer has the same gap.
